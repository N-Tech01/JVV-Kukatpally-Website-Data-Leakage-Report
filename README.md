# JVV Kukatpally Website Data Leakage Report

## Overview
Hello,  
My name is Navarath, and I would like to bring a potential security issue to your attention. I discovered this issue while exploring websites using Google Dorks as part of my learning in basic ethical hacking at CADD Centre. I am currently studying in 8th standard.

## Description of the Issue
While searching through Google, I came across sensitive data accessible on the **JVV Kukatpally website**. Specifically, I noticed that some private data is exposed through the following link:  
`https://jvvkukatpally.com/admin/uploads/`

This directory contains sensitive files that could be accessed without authentication, such as:

- 8061039Audit Report  
- 14924721tccccc.php.pdf  
- 16146676alfa.php  
- 17344575kocu.png  
- 50334046na.pdf
- etc...
  

And several others. These files appear to contain confidential information, including audit reports, personal data, and other sensitive documents, which should not be exposed.

> **Note**: The link is functional and accessible.

## Steps to Discover
1. Use Google Dorks to search for sensitive directories and files exposed to the public.
2. Review the accessible files through the identified directories.
